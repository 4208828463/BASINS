<h>Automated Graph Generation</h>

<ol>
<li>HSPEXP+ can generate additional graphs for water quality, snow depth, frequency duration, scatter plots, etc. The specifications for these graphs must be provided in one or more comma-separated file (*.csv format).</li>
<li>The time series for these graphs can be obtained from a WDM file, HBN file, or a <a href="../Using HSPEXP+/Setting up the Project/Setting up BASINS Observed WQ File">DBF (BASINS Observed WQ file format) file. </a>
<li>HSPEXP+ also outputs the dataset used for generating the graphs in tab delimited text files. Users can utilize this data for additional analysis outside of BASINS or HSPEXP+.</li>
