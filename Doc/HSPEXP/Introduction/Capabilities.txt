<h>Capabilities of HSPEXP+</h>

<p>HSPEXP+ can help in <a href="Hydrologic Calibration">hydrologic</a> and <a href="Water Quality Calibration">water quality calibration</a> of a watershed model that is developed using HSPF.  HSPEXP+ produces several graphs for hydrologic calibration.  HSPEXP+, can also be used to generate additional graphs (timeseries, frequency duration, and scatter plots) using its <a href="Automated Graph Generation">automated graph generation</a> capability.

<p>Unlike its predecessor HSPEXP, HSPEXP+ cannot be used to edit HSPF UCI file interactively.  HSPEXP+ cannot generate the BASINS Specifications (EXS) file as well. HSPEXP+ users must prepare the EXS file in a text editor, and edit the UCI file using WinHSPF or a text editor (based on the calibration results and advice generated by HSPEXP+).</p>
