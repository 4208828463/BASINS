<h>Water Quality Calibration</h>

<p>HSPEXP+ does not require the EXS file for water quality calibration tasks. HSPEXP+ can create simulated and observed data graphs as described in <a ref="Automated Graph Generation">Automated Graph Generation</a> Section. </>

<ol>
<li>HSPEXP+ generates nutrient balance reports in a variety of layouts for sediment, total nitrogen, and total phosphorus.</li>
<li>HSPEXP+ produces "Regan Plots" - a plot of simulated phytoplankton, and benthic algae, along with multiple nutrients at all the reaches.</li>
<li>HSPEXP+ does not calculate statistics to compare observed and simulated water quality data; however, it provides reports and graphs to better understand the water quality simulation, and guide changes in the parameters accordingly. It does not provide advice for water quality parameter adjustments.</li>
</ol>
