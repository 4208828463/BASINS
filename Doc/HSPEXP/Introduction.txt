<h>Introduction</h>

<p>HSPEXP stands for Expert System for Calibration of HSPF.  The legacy version of HSPEXP was developed by the USGS (Lumb et al., 1994). HSPEXP+ is the next generation of HSPEXP.</p>

<p>HSPEXP+ has been completely re-designed and shares only the legacy input file format, mathematical formulae, and algorithms from HSPEXP.  HSPEXP+ can perform several additional functions, and it is evolving into a comprehensive hydrologic and water quality calibration tool for HSPF. </p>
