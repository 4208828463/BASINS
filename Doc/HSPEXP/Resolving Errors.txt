<h>Resolving Errors</h>

<p>HSPEXP+ assumes that the user has provided correct data in all the model set-up files; currently, error checking in HSPEXP+ is minimal and rudimentary. In some cases, HSPEXP+ may generate some common errors as a pop-up (if the format of some input in the EXS file is wrong, or if some required files are missing). HSPEXP+ also produces a log file every time it is run. Referring to the log file may give some indication of the cause of the error.</p>

<p>In most cases, you may have to refer to the help manual, and make sure that all input files are set up correctly.</p>
